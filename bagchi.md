I wrote an extended abstract with Professor Saurabh Bagchi on offloading data filtration for Internet of Things sensors. In June 2022, I was invited to present my work at the international Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) conference in Baltimore. This was an incredible opportunity for me to grow my research and communication skills.<br><br>

<br>My work seeks to optimally approximate fixed-point multiplication on a programmable switch to perform digital IIR filtering. For a stream of real-time IoT data, offloading digital filtering computations allows edge devices to allocate more CPU cycles for processing analytics in parallel. Multiplication is approximated through an adaptive bit width precision lookup table, and the formulas for the maximum possible percentage error and the memory consumption are shown. The users can access and alter the 32-bit filter coefficients to reflect the specifications of the desired IIR filter. This offers extensive flexibility for users to alter the filter characteristics through software.<br><br>
