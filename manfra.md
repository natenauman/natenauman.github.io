I knew that my programming and FPGA skills would not be enough to attain my goals of doing meaningful graduate research on quantum materials for nanoelectronics, so I started volunteering in Professor Michael Manfraâ€™s Quantum Semiconductor Systems Group at the beginning of the summer in 2022. Since then, I have gained experience measuring the quantum Hall effect and the density of states of various devices, including MBE-grown Josephson junction geometries, in multiple dilution refrigerators. Early in the fall semester, the laboratory faced a problem in which we needed the ability to take forty concurrent sample measurements, but the Helium-3 refrigerator probe attachment did not have enough pins. I was determined to solve this issue, so I designed custom PCBs and brass pieces and constructed a new sample holder for the probe. This allowed me to more fully understand the equipment necessary for low-temperature measurements of devices.
