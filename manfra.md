I started volunteering in Professor Michael Manfraâ€™s Quantum Semiconductor Systems Group at the beginning of the summer in 2022. Since then, I have gained experience measuring the quantum Hall effect in various devices, including MBE-grown heterostructures, in multiple dilution refrigerators. Early in the fall semester, the laboratory faced a problem in which we needed the ability to take forty sample measurements, but the Helium-3 refrigerator probe attachment did not have enough pins. I designed custom PCBs and brass pieces and constructed a new sample holder for the probe. This allowed me to more fully understand the equipment necessary for low-temperature measurements of devices.<br><br>
