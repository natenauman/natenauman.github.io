I had the honor of being invited to the 52nd Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) in Baltimore, Maryland this summer. This opportunity is particularly exciting since this is my first time presenting at a conference of this scale. During the spring 2022 semester, I took Professor Saurabh Bagchi's graduate-level course "Fault-Tolerant Computer System Design" where I worked with my colleague Ruochong Wu on an extended abstract for offloading analytical computations in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. At the end of the semester, Professor Bagchi awarded Ruochong and I the award for the best project.

Originally, I was planning to help program triple-core processors for an electric vehicle company in India, but I decided to stay in the US for the summer so that I could attend the DSN conference and continue doing research on campus. It has been such a wonderful experience to be able to connect with graduate students from all over the world. Right before my presentation, I had the chance to meet a Ph.D. student from Poland and speak to him in depth about his project about tracking human movements for sources of randomness.
