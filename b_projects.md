					<h3>Robotic Arm with Cabling Linkages</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As part of my senior design project, I built and programmed a robotic arm with cabling linkages with three other group memebers. A set of coordinates can be sent to the STM32 microcontroller from the user interface and the robotic arm finds the optimal path to that point through inverse kinematics.</p>

					<h3>Multicore Processor on FPGA</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Purdue is the only university in the country that offers a course dedicated to building a multicore processor with cache coherency. I designed the pipelined processor as part of an individual project and expanded the hardware to include a second core as well as instruction and data caches with my teammate.</p>
