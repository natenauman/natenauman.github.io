					<h3>Smart Robotic Arm with Advanced Cabling Linkages</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As project leader, I worked closely with my teammates to design and build the mechanical and electrical components for one of the most ambitious senior design projects at Purdue University. This robotic limb finds the optimal path to any given coordinate and moves its end effector with the help of a revolutionary new elbow joint design. All the motors are centered at the base of the robot and force multiplication in each joint is achieved through pulleys and cabling linkages.</p>

					<h3>Multicore Processor on FPGA</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Designing and implmenting a pipelined, multicore processor with cache coherency remains one of the most difficult yet rewarding projects of my life. Purdue is the only university in the country that offers a course dedicated to such an extensive FPGA project. Prior to this class, I studied digital design on FPGA boards in two semesters of undergraduate ASIC design courses. I also wrote dual thread programs in the assembly language MIPS to test my designs.</p>
