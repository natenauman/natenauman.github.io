					<h3>Smart Robotic Arm with Advanced Cabling Linkages</h3>
				</header>
				<p>As project leader, I worked closely with my teammates to design and build the mechanical and electrical components for one of the most ambitious senior design projects at Purdue University. This robotic limb finds the optimal path to any given coordinate and moves its end effector with the help of a revolutionary new elbow joint design. All the motors are centered at the base of the robot and force amplication in each joint is achieved through pulleys and tensioned cables.</p>

					<h3>Multicore Processor on FPGA</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Purdue is the only university in the country that offers a course dedicated to building a multicore processor with cache coherency. I designed the pipelined processor as part of an individual project and expanded the hardware to include a second core as well as instruction and data caches with my teammate.</p>
