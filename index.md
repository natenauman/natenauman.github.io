    <p>I am a master's student in computer engineering at Purdue University. I graduated with Honors from Purdue University in 2022, where I received my BS in Computer Engineering and minors in both Mathematics and Arabic.<br>
    My research interests are materials where quantum mechanics gives rise to extraordinary exotic properties through magnetism, topology, or superconductivity. I am excited to explore novel device physics in my Ph.D.<br><br>
