    <p>I am a master's student in computer engineering at Purdue University. I graduated with Honors from Purdue University in 2022, where I received my BS in Computer Engineering and minors in both Mathematics and Arabic.
    My research interests are materials where quantum mechanics gives rise to extraordinary exotic properties through magnetism, topology, or superconductivity.</p>
