    <p>I was born in New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz. I am currently a master's student in Electrical Engineering at Purdue University. In 2022, I graduated with  my BS Honors in Computer Engineering from Purdue along with minors in Mathematics and Arabic.<br><br>
    My research interests are photonics and materials where quantum mechanics gives rise to extraordinary exotic properties through magnetism and topology. I was recently awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for my proposal on magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets.<br><br>
