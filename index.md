    <p>I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering (2022) and M.S. in Electrical Engineering (2023) from Purdue University with minors in Math and Arabic. I am an NSF GRFP Fellow and a recipient of the State Departmentâ€™s Critical Language Scholarship for Bengali. At Purdue, my research included developing probabilistic computing architectures on FPGA for p-bit accelerators under advisor Professor Supriyo Datta. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at Columbia University in Professor Keren Bergman's Lightwave Research Laboratory with special interests in photonic integrated circuit design, device physics, and quantum interconnects.<br><br>
