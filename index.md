    <p>I was born in New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz. In four years, I earned both my master's and bachelors degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. In May 2023, I earned my master's degree in Electrical Engineering and contributed to projects related to probabilistic-bits, low-temperature device characterization, and fault-tolerant computing. In December 2022, I earned my bachelor's degree with Honors in Computer Engineering along with minors in Mathematics and Arabic.<br><br>
    This summer, I will study Bangla full-time at the American Institute for Indian Studies in Kolkata, India as part of the State Department's Critical Language Scholarship. This fall, I will join Professor Keren Bergman's Lightwave Laboratory at Columbia University to research silicon photonics, specifically optical and quantum interconnects. I was recently awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for my proposal on magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets.<br><br>
