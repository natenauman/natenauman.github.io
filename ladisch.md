I led a team comprised of two other students, one from animal sciences and the other from agribusiness, under Distinguished Professor Michael Ladisch to invent and experimentally validate a new soy-based biostimulant. We won an award of $20,000 and gave numerous interviews. In August 2021, I was invited to speak about the environmental benefits of my biostimulant product with Indianaâ€™s Industry Affairs Committee, a panel composed of state senators and industry leaders. This was an opportunity for me to convey my work to people with non-technical backgrounds. While in Professor Ladisch's lab, I also gained experience analyzing proteins with high-performance liquid chromotagraphy equipment.
